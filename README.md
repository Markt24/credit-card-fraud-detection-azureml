# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Azure Machine Learning Studio

This project demonstrates how I built, trained, and deployed a machine learning model in **Azure Machine Learning Studio** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. I was recently tasked with creating an end-to-end ML workflow that includes data ingestion, automated model training, evaluation, and endpoint scoring using Azure’s powerful low-code environment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a classification model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions. Using Azure ML Studio, I performed the following:

- Prepared and cleaned the dataset
- Built a classification pipeline using Azure’s drag-and-drop designer
- Trained multiple algorithms and selected the best-performing model
- Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC score
- Deployed the trained model as a real-time inference endpoint
- Generated test scoring code using REST API + Python

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The best model was selected based on:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- AUC / ROC Curve  

These metrics ensure the model focuses on **reducing false negatives**, which is critical in fraud detection.
